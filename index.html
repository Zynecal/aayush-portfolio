            Setting clear career goals is essential for me, as it ensures I stay focused on what I truly want to
            acheive. As for my career, my interests lie in the field of aerospace engineeering and computer science. I
            aspire to work at an aerospace firm, or take a look at a career in silicon valley at a tech firm. To achieve
            this goal, in high school I am planning to take up many internships at tech and aerospace firms, as well as
            being involved with being a memeber of clubs and associations that can boost my chances of having my dream
            career. Ever since I was 7 was always fascinated by computers and the inner workings of complex machines.
            Throughout the years, my passion for computers has only increased, and that is why I chose computer science
            as my elective. I hope it will serve as a pathway into the tech field and only make my interest and passion
            for computers and programming stronger.

            A few character traits that I hold close to me and posses are being able to cooperate with others, I work
            well
            in a team, and use critical thinking and logical problem solving skills to get work done and find solutions
            to
            possible problems. Programmers need to be able to think critically, as their entire job focuses on create
            solutions for existing problems and being able to debug and fix code. Therefore, they need creative
            approaches
            to problems and need to be able to think outside the box. A large part of programming is also working
            together
            with a team. I am able to cooperate effectivley and posses leadership abilities that are valuable in the
            workplace.

            Some of my accomplishments from high school so far in freshman year are being a member of DECA, having 15+
            volunteering hours so far in the year, being a member of FTC Robotics and Emerald Hackathon club as well. I
            am
            also a part of Dublin Lead for volenteering and community service projects. As well as doing those activies,
            I have done many projects on my own. For example, when I was 11 I built a personal computer from parts I
            researched online, and I still use this computer to
            this day. When I was 12 and 13 I created a webserver using a Rasberry Pi and a Ardunio mini computer, and
            was able to host many of my own websites on it. However, these are my own independant projects and are not
            related to my highschool portfolio. I also play basketball as a hobby and on a team. It has taught me the
            importance of teamwork, collaboration, being able to perservere and overcome adversity, as well as
            dedication and determination. Overall, I see myself as an open-midned, creative person who never backs down
            from an honest challege, whether thats on the basketball court or at my desk behind my computer. I am a well
            rounded individual who always gives his 100% no matter the circumstances. But thats enough about me, so
            thanks for reading and welcome to my site! You are welcome to make yourself at home and explore!
